    "# Protocol for a distributed synthetic market\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a protocol for matching **state contingent contracts** linear between an upper and lower bound and at a particular expiry.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"img/BFC.png\"  width=500>\n",
    "\n",
    "These contracts can be combined to construct standard forward and option contracts or event markets (payoffs depending on a discrete). \n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"img/StackedBFC.png\" width=500>\n",
    "\n",
    "The protocol uses a chain of signatures to verify orders. Orders are accepted by the market if they have a valid signature and the trader's positions satisfiy a collateral check across all possible worst outcomes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Markets are settled by the market owner adding a new upper and lower bound for a market equal to a single number. For example, the lower bound for each market is the highest lower bound for itself of any sub-market or any previous.\n",

    "\n",
    "Since orders can only be added to the order book and not subtracted, creating a matched order requires an offset of the unmatched order and a new matched order of equal size.\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider an order '(p=0.5, q=0.5)'. For the trade to successfully be matched it requires at minimum:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Primary  (p=0.5, q=10, isMatched = 0) \n",
    "- Offset  (p=0.5, q=-10, isMatched = 0)\n",
    "- Match (p=0.5, q=10, isMatchced = 1)\n",
    "\n",
    "Optionally, the trade an also include a reduction trade for the market to use to kill an existing order to make way for a new order. These don't need offsets.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Reduction  (p=0.5, q=10*-0.1=-1, isMatched=1)\n",
    "\n",
    "Geometrically, this set of trades can be represented in (p,q) space:\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"img\\OrderGeometry1.png\" width = 600>\n",
    "\n",
    "It is useful to allow partial fills (lower quantity and weakly better price). Each partial trade only requires a matched version and not an offset.\n",
    "\n",
    "[Geometry of single trade with partial fill region]\n",
    "\n",
    "Any non-primary trade that is picked up for a match is set as primary by the system so it can be picked up in future collateral calculations (this is the only changable field in the order book).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Geometry of signature chain \n",
    "\n",
    "Each trade is chained to a previous trade according to some rule. The order book will require a valid signature (valid signature for message and valid previous node) and a collateral check. Primary and partial orders are chained to a previous valid order, while offset and reductions are chained to the primary trade.\n",
