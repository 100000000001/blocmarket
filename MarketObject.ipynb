    "# Protocol for a distributed synthetic market\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a protocol for matching **state contingent contracts** that give a payoff linear between an upper and lower bound and at a particular expiry.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"img/BFC.png\"  width=500>\n",
    "\n",
    "For example the contract might pay \\$1 for each 10mm of rainfall above 30mm. If the amount of rainfall is above 30mm the payoff is \\$1 and if the outcome is below 30mm the outcome is zero.\n",
    "\n",
    "These contracts can be combined to construct standard forward and option contracts or event markets (payoffs depending on a discrete set of outcomes). \n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"img/StackedBFC.png\" width=500>\n",
    "\n",
    "The protocol uses a chain of signatures to organize buy and sell orders for these contracts. Orders are accepted if they have a valid signature and the trader's positions satisfiy a collateral check across all possible worst outcomes. To maintain an appropriate record of the order book, trades can only be added, and the validity of any trade can be checked by anyone using public keys provided by each participant.\n",
    "\n",
    "Markets are settled by the market owner adding a new upper and lower bound for a market equal to a single number. For example, the lower bound for each market is the highest lower bound for itself of  any sub-market or any previous bound on the same market. Market bounds *telescope*, making a market the *underlying asset* of its sub-markets. \n",
